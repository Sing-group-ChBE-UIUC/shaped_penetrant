# shaped_penetrant
This is the github repository for studying shaped penetrant diffusion in highly crosslinked networks. For more detailed information, please refer to 

## Create initial configuration

## Run simulations on LAMMPS

### Create crosslinked networks at T=1

### Study diffusion at target T

## Post analysis

## Raw data for figures in main article and supporting information
